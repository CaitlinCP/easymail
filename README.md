# Easymail

Easymail is a simple, one-page Python app with a Tkinter UI that converts user-generated text input into HTML, and inserts it into an HTML template for fundraising and advocacy emails.

<strong>To Run:</strong>

Ensure Python 3.11 is installed, and that the Tkinter package is included.

Do not alter names of template files or folders, or change their location.

Navigate to the Easymail folder and run <code>python app.py</code>

<strong>Using Easymail:</strong>

Users will add information needed to generate the email (image url, link url, etc) in a form above the text input. Then, users will paste text into the input box, and add formatting tags by highlighting text and selecting a tag from the toolbar above the input menu.
