# Easymail

Easymail is a simple, one-page Python app with a Tkinter UI that converts user-generated text input into HTML, and inserts it into an HTML template for fundraising-style emails. This was initially developed as a a project for a previous non-profit employer, and is now being developed as a personal project. Note that the current HTML template is rough, and can be updated by changing the hero_template.txt file in the templates folder.

<strong>To Run:</strong>

Ensure Python 3.11 is installed, and that the Tkinter package is included.

Do not alter names of template files or folders, or change their location.

Navigate to the Easymail folder and run <code>python app.py</code>

<strong>Using Easymail:</strong>

Users will add information needed to generate the email (image url, link url, etc) in a form above the text input. Then, users will paste text into the input box, and add formatting tags by highlighting text and selecting a tag from the toolbar above the input menu.
